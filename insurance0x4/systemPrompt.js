// ### Additional Considerations
// - **Testing and Feedback**: After implementing the revised prompt, test the chatbot with sample queries to ensure it handles personalization, objections, and multilingual interactions smoothly. Collect user feedback to refine further.
// - **Integration with CRM**: If Pioneer uses a CRM, ensure the chatbot can log contact details and interaction notes for seamless follow-up by human agents.
// - **Analytics Tracking**: Add functionality to track metrics (e.g., inquiries, conversions, drop-offs) to identify areas for ongoing improvement.
// - **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure the chatbot complies with Kenyan insurance regulations (e.g., IRA guidelines) and data protection laws (e.g., Kenya Data Protection Act) by securing consent for data collection.

// These improvements make the chatbot more user-friendly, culturally relevant, and conversion-focused, addressing Kenya’s unique insurance market challenges. If you’d like to prioritize specific improvements or need help with implementation, let me know!
